# Anna-Wilson-Process-Portfolio






**Week One:**

potential "textbook production": 
Here is my thought on why you may give visme.co a chance,
pros:
1- Real time update for any edits

2- Team member can collaborate and work in the same project at the same time

3- You can choose different medium to rely your info

4- You can interactivity to your content

5- It's free! with different pre-made templet to choose from

cons:
1- depending on what machine & internet you use it may run slow

2- You need to sign up for free acc




**Week Two:**

Javascript Style Guides https://my.visme.co/view/dmy7ezjv-javascript-style-guides-2

java scripts seem like the kid of java & html, it share some of each coding best practice.
It's also focus on readability so you can bend the roles when you see fit.
As new programmer naming convention might be a challenge, I prop need to remind myself as I can see it happening often




**Week Three:**

What are JS APIs? 
It's the middle piece that can communicate information between two, It can take the user input preference or search to the main server to find a page or an item. 

You can use the API by inserting the URL to your code which will reflect the information requested, an example of this could be an API that asks public wifi users to agree in terms and conditions to use the wifi, another application to get feed from social media acc up to date to reflect on your website.

Navigating MDN Web Docs API library 
the information is written in a clear direct format, on the left side you can choose what API you looking to use once that click more information will display on how to use it and what other action it can perform.

API that would be helpful for my app:
- Alarm Manager API
- Time API
- Wather based on location

Reflection: 
I notice that writing codes & adding a comment explaining each line make it easier to understand it when I'm lost
As well having a bookmark folder of important blogs or other material for each project make it easier to refer to it later.
Something I'm looking forward to in this documentation, 
to have one place for all related codes or articles for my app to be able to put them together once it's done
